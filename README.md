# Memory Pair Game

A card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface
and two cards are flipped face up over each turn.
The objective of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
The game ends when the last pair has been picked up.

The game is developed as a task from
[Kottans frontend course](https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko/kottans_frontend).
